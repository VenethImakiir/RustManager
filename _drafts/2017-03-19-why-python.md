Why python? That's a good question actually. Mostly because a huge amount of companies develops web apps in java.

But web-oriented companies focuses on Ruby. Front-end devs in need of some backend functionalities tend to support themselves with PHP. And at last here is the Python, capable of implementing web-based apps and becoming more and more useful in that field.

At first I also wanted to use Java+JS combo. Every web project in my company was developed in Java - as it later turned out it was caused by two things:
 * Almost every programmer in the company was a Java developer and it was less expensive to use them than to hire new programmers
 * Java is the best for big data projects
