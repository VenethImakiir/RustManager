Ok, time for more details about the project, the language chosen by me, project requirements and so on.

<!--more-->

First thing - I had this project in mind for some time now but got pushed into action when my wife told me about ["Get Noticed! 2017"](http://devstyle.pl/daj-sie-poznac/) contest. The site is in Polish, but well.. it's a Polish contest. Main objective is to do something you have had in mind and show it to the world. Who cares about the prizes? Those are optional and really not important. The most important is that it can secure me at least some motivation to go on with the project. I'm just one of those people who need an external source of motivation to do something for themselves.

But w8, there's more! :D

Every project needs a plan and some minimal requirements. And lots of us know that more than enough after prticipating in project without one.

As for the requirements:
* Drag & Drop plugin scripts upload
* web plugin editor
* web plugin reload without server restart

Optional requirements:
* One-click LGMS/rust server install
* server commands management
* server up/down management
* player list
* plugin browser compatible with Oxide

Plan:
* set up the blog
* set up the python + rust server
* run the server and check out the commands, API and mechanics
* start writing first scripts

The last point of the plan is a milestone. When I reach it I'll revise the plan and checkout the requirements (b/c rust updates could make my reqs obsolete). So next post will be about setting up the python install and rust server on linux (in my case Debian) machine!
